# ui-dashboard

This project was quite challenging. It was a milestone for me to take a design from Figma and implement it with code. I used Grid and flexbox to style the layout. 
It isn't mobile responsive because the design files only had the desktop version.

## How I made this

### Approach
I first had to visualize the design. what goes where? what technologies would be helpful? and which would give me the most flexibility?

### Technologies involved

The course I took on frontendmaster regarding responsive layout was very helpful for this project. I'd say it's one of the most interesting projects I've built. 
It was really challenging at some point but that's where Google saved the day. Googling is really an underated skill.

### Conclusion

Exciting project that helped me practice my css skills
